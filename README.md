# Shipper_X_Y_Transport
Mobile App of Freight Go.
The Indian Logistics Supply market (trucking) is a very fragmented market and there is no
generalization or standards in terms of processes, pricing or service level.
Consider a Shipper company X. In order to fulfill a delivery requirement, X has to tie up with a
Transporter company and finalize on the freight (or use in house transport if available) for
executing a particular order.
Process through a mobile app. For a Shipper, the key pillars of expectations would be
● Digitization
● Visibility
● Analytics & Performance

Output
● Wireframes supported by user flows to narrate the process/tasks workflow.
● 4 high-fidelity UI screens.
● User personas for the ideal customers.
● User Journey(s) for the personas you identify.
● Any other UX design deliverables you feel would support your idea - Information
architecture, User storyboards, Competitive analysis etc).
